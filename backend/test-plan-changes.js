/**
 * Test Plan Changes - Trial Period Handling
 * 
 * This file documents the expected behavior for plan changes during trial periods
 * and verifies that the subscription controller handles them correctly.
 * 
 * SCENARIO: User creates subscription with 3-day trial, then upgrades to premium
 * 
 * EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
 * 1. User creates subscription → 3-day trial starts
 * 2. User upgrades to premium during trial → No immediate charge, plan changes immediately
 * 3. When trial ends → User is charged the premium plan price
 * 
 * FIXES APPLIED:
 * 1. upgradePlan() now detects trial periods and skips immediate charging
 * 2. previewUpgrade() now shows correct trial period upgrade preview
 * 3. Webhook handler already properly updates plan snapshots
 * 
 * TEST CASES:
 * - Trial period upgrade (no immediate charge)
 * - Regular period upgrade (immediate proration charge)
 * - Downgrade (no immediate charge, takes effect next cycle)
 * - Same price change (no charge, features change immediately)
