Great! Now let me explain how the trial email logic works and how you can simulate the day 2 email.
How the Trial Email Logic Works
Current Implementation:
Day 1 Email - Sent immediately when trial is activated (via webhook)
Day 2 Email - Sent by the cron job after 24 hours
Day 3 Morning Email - Sent by the cron job after 48 hours
Day 3 Evening Email - Sent by the cron job after 60 hours OR via Stripe's trial_will_end webhook
Cancellation Emails - Sent immediately when cancelled, then 24h and final day via cron job
The Cron Job Logic:
The cron job runs every hour and checks:
Trial start date from our database (userSubscription.startDate)
Calculates hours passed since trial started
Sends appropriate emails based on timing and what hasn't been sent yet
Let me show you how to simulate Day 2 email:
How to Simulate Day 2 Email
There are several ways to simulate the Day 2 email:
Option 1: Create a Test Endpoint (Recommended)

POST /api/test-trial-email
Authorization: Bearer <your-token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "emailType": "day2"
}
Let's create a test endpoint that can manually trigger trial emails:
Now let's add routes for these test functions:
How to Simulate Day 2 Email
Now you have several options to test the Day 2 email:
Option 1: Force Send Day 2 Email (Immediate)
Option 2: Test Cron Logic (Respects Timing)

POST /api/test-trial-email-cron
Authorization: Bearer <your-token>

This will check if 24+ hours have passed and send the appropriate email.
Option 3: Manually Update Database (Advanced)

// Set startDate to 25 hours ago
db.usersubscriptions.updateOne(
  { userId: ObjectId("your-user-id"), isTrialPeriod: true },
  { $set: { startDate: new Date(Date.now() - (25 * 60 * 60 * 1000)) } }
)


You can manually update your trial subscription's startDate in the database to simulate time passing:
Then call the cron test endpoint.
Option 4: Change Cron Schedule (Testing)

// Change from '0 * * * *' (every hour) to '* * * * *' (every minute)
cron.schedule('* * * * *', async () => {


You can temporarily change the cron job to run every minute for testing by modifying trialEmailCron.js:
Current Email Flow Summary:
Database-driven: Uses userSubscription.startDate to calculate timing
Cron job: Runs every hour and checks what emails need to be sent
Stripe webhook: Only handles trial_will_end for final day emails
Immediate emails: Sent directly from functions (day 1, cancellation immediate)
Try using the test endpoints to simulate the Day 2 email!
