## Tips:

1. **Company URL is the only required field** - other fields can be left empty and will be generated by AI
2. **Maximum 50 rows** will be imported at once
3. **Column order doesn't matter** - the system will auto-detect columns by name
4. **Case insensitive** - "company url" and "Company URL" work the same
5. **Flexible naming** - use variations like "job_title" or "Job Title" as needed
